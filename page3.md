# Coronaviruse Testing Positive Rate
My initial assumption is that each Province is using similar criteria to determine if a person is to be tested for Coronavirus.  If Coronavirus is evenly distributed across the Provinces, testing should reveal a similar positive test rate.

In the above chart, it is apparent that the positive test rate varies significantly across from Province to Province.  This indicates that:
1. The testing criteria are not uniform across the Provinces.<br/>
*or*<br/>
2. The Coronavirus infection rate is not equal across the Provinces.
