# Coronaviruse Testing Positive Rate
As mentioned before, I am assuming that each Province is using similar criteria to determine when a person is tested for Coronavirus.  If Coronaviruse is evenly distributed accros the Provinces, testing should reveal a similare positive test rate.

In the above chart, it is apparent that the positive test rate varies significately across the Provinces.  This indicates that:
1. The testing criteria are not uniform across the Provinces.
2. The Coronaviruse infection rate is not equal across the Provinces.
