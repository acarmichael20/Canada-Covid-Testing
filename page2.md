# Coronavirus Testing Per 1,000 People
As of April 19, 2020, the majority of the Covid cases in Canada are in Quebec and Ontario. These two Provinces, arguably have larger, more robust healthcare infrastructure than other Provinces in Canada.  Could the higher number of Covid cases in Ontario and Quebec be a result of their healthcare systems ability to test more people?

The above chart shows the number of tests per 1,000 people in each Province.  Ontario and Quebec are not even in the top 5 Provinces for testing.  It is evident that larger number of Coronavirus cases in Ontario and Quebec are not due to testing a larger proportion of the population.
