# Coronavirus Positive Test Rate Over Time

Much of the analysis being done on flattening the curve is centered on the increase in cases of Coronavirus day over day. I think focusing on this approach is wrong because the number of cases is tied to the number of tests. A better metric to look at what proportion of tests are positive.  

Since the testing data is dirty, therefore looking at the Coronavirus positive rate over a time span of a week will produce more realistice numbers for analysis.
