# Coronavirus Positive Test Rate Over Time

Much of the analysis being done on flattening the curve is centered on the increase in cases of Coronavirus day over day. I think focusing on this approach is wrong because the number of cases is tied to the number of tests. A better metric to look at what proportion of tests are positive.  

Since the testing data is dirty, therefore looking at the Coronavirus positive rate over a time span of a week will produce more realistice numbers for analysis.

In the above chart, Coronavirus appears to be continuing to spread in Ontario as indicated by the increasing positive test rate. Quebec seems to reducing the spread of the virus but is still finding an infection rate of ~13%.
