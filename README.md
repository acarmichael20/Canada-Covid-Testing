# Introduction
Most of the Coronavirus data driven work I have seen has been tracking the number of:
- cases
- deaths
- recoveries

I will be taking a different approach and will be exploring the data on Coronavirus testing in each province. I believe the results of the testing can produce a better understanding of the severity of the pandemic in each Province.

# Data sources:
[Canadian Coronavirus Testing Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada/master/testing_cumulative.csv)

[Canadian Population by Province](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&T=1201&S=22&O=A)

[Canadian Coronavirus Cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)

# Assumptions
1.	The population data is from the 2016 census, I am assuming that the population has not grown significantly in the last four years.
2.	Test are associated with the day they were taken.  A test given on April 1 is reported on April 1.
3.	The cases are reported the same way testing is reported.
4.	The criteria to receive a test is the same across all Provinces and Territories.
5.	The data being reported is correct.
